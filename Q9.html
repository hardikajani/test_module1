        <p>Q9 Difference between var and let keyword in javascript explain with examples ?.</p>
        <p>The difference between let and var is in the scope of the variables they create: Variables declared by let are only available inside the block where they're defined. Variables declared by var are available throughout the function in which they're declared.</p>

        <p>examples:</p>


    </div>

    <script>
        var num1=10;
        let num2=10;
        

    </script>
</body>
