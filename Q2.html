        <p>Q2 Explain Hoisting in javascript explain with examples.</p>
        <p>Ans: This is because the JavaScript interpreter splits the declaration and assignment of functions and variables: it "hoists" your declarations to the top of their containing scope before execution. This process is called hoisting, and it allows us to use foo before its declaration in our example above.</p>
        <p>examples:</p>
        


    </div>

    <script>
        console.log(a);
        var a="Hello";

        // Declaration
        var foo;
        let bar;

        // Assignment
        foo = 'foo';
        bar = 'bar';
         
        
    </script>
